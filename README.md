### Problem Statement

The objective of this project was to analyze HealthConnect's comprehensive patient database to address the following key questions:

- Demographic Associations with Health Conditions: How do factors such as age and gender correlate with specific health conditions?
- Variation in Admission Types: How does the type of patient admission (e.g., emergency, elective, urgent) differ across various demographics and health conditions?
- Patterns in Healthcare Services: Are there identifiable patterns in the utilization of healthcare services, such as medication and billing amounts, when considering patient demographics and health conditions?

### Data Cleaning Process

- Removed Duplicates: Identified and eliminated 534 duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
- Checked for Empty Cells: Performed a thorough check for any empty cells across the dataset; no missing values were found.
- Trimmed Cell Values: Applied trimming functions to remove any unnecessary leading or trailing spaces in text fields.
- Standardized Text Formatting: Adjusted inconsistent text cases to maintain uniformity throughout the dataset.
